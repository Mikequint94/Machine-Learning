2 types.  Regression (ex. predict height based on weight of person)
          Classification (is pic a dog or cat)

Python is number 1 language for machine learning stuff
Jupyter.org for viewing his notebooks.

Linear Least Squares Regression, predicting y value given x value.

Unexplained variance is called noise (factors effecting price other than height of skyscraper)

common way to assess error is SSE. Sum of Squares Error.  Using squared error is better if we think noise is evenly distributed.
((Theta0 + Theta1*x) - y)^2.   Theta0 is like b and Theta1 is like m in y = mx+b

Common output is average SSE. so divide by number of data points.

Machine Learning is just like statistics. lol. Using software to do these computations, how can software work on large datasets.
